Which Finch Read Me

Created in February 2022 after learning from the guidebook Head First HTML & CSS.

This page is made only used HTML & CSS and was my first personal project. The txt files for each of the pages are present as I made this using text editor, and each time a change to the code was made, I would copy the text document and change the file type to html, and so the text documents were included in the parent file upload.
