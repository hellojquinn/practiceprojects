		<h1>The Zebra Finch</h1>
		 <p>
			Zebra finches are the most common songbird in Australia. 	
			There are over 50 different colour mutations mainly found
			in captive breeding, most males have a mix of white, black,
			grey, orange and brown colours; female are uniformly grey. 		
			Both sexes have red eyes (easily seen in sunlight) and orange
			beak.

		<h2>Geography</h2>

		 <p>
			Zebra Finches live all over Australia, mainly in more
			arid parts close to water, and typically avoid the
			cool south and tropical north and also can be found
			on Timor Island. They live in grasslands, savannahs and 
			woodlands with scattered trees and shrubs, or 
			even cultivated areas like rice fields.

		<h2>Habits & Lifestyle</h2>
		 <p>
			Zebra finches are social birds and can live in flocks, or 		
			charms, of up to 500 and tend to do things in groups such as 	
			foraging, bathing, preening, eating, gathering nesting 	
			material, and exploring their environment. It is not 		
			uncommon for a single finch to begin an activity and call out 		
			with a loud "meep" for others to join in.
