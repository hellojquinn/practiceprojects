			underparts and tail a brilliant blue. Males have a distinct magenta coloured cheek, 
			whereas females have the light brown/grey wrap under their chin like a bonnet. There is 
			also a close relative known as the Blue-Capped Cordon Bleu Finch.

			are not migratory. It has also been introduced to the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and 
			Oahu. They inhabit a wide variety of habitat including dry thorn scrub, all types of 
			savanna, villages and cultivated areas.

		<h2>Habits & Lifestyle</h2>
		 <p>
			Usually found in pairs or small flocks or charms, and always close to a water source. 
			The males sing a rhythmic series of high pitched notes with the last note being longer 
			and lower in pitch, and unlike most other passerine type birds, the females will also 
			sing but their song is less complex.
