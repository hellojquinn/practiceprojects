		<h2>Geography</h2>

		 <p>

		<h2>Habits & Lifestyle</h2>
		 <p>
			Flocks of these finches can number 10-30 but can build to hundreds but are under threat 
			of overgrazing of grasslands limiting coverage and food sources for them. They are 
			granivorous, foraging in vegetation just above the ground, but have been known to eat 
			flying insects just as flies and moths.
