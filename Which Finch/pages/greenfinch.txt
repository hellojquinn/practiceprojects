		<h1>The Greenfinch</h1>
		 <p>
			The European Greenfinch is similar in size and shape to a House Sparrow, but it is 
			mainly green, with a large yellow stripe on its wings and tail. The female and 
			fledglings are duller with brown tones on their back. The Greenfinches beak is 
			thick and cone-like. The male also has a "butterfly" courtship display during 
			flight.

		<h2>Geography</h2>

		 <p>
			European Greenfinches are widespread throughout Europe, North Africa, and Southwest 
			Asia. They are mainly residents but some in the northern parts do migrate further 
			south. They inhabit forests, woodland edges, farmland, parks, and relatively thick 
			vegetation which is usually favoured during breeding.

		<h2>Habits & Lifestyle</h2>
		 <p>
			European Greenfinches are social birds and can form large flocks outside breeding 			
			season, sometimes mixing with other finches and buntings. They are active during the 
			day spending their time hopping between tree branches in search of food. Their song 
			contains a lot of trilling between wheezes.
