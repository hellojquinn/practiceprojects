		<h1>The Owl Finch</h1>
		 <p>
			Also known as the Double-Barred Finch, native to Australia. They have two black bars 
			across their chest with a white face, black eyes, grey beak, white chest and black 
			rump, brown wings with white speckles. There is difficulty in identifying sex except 
			males sing, so separating and listening is often employed.

		<h2>Geography</h2>

		 <p>
			Owl Finches are found in northern and eastern Australia, typically within dry savannah,
			scrublands, wood and grasslands, and have been known to be seen in city parks and 
			cultivated areas such as sugarcane fields as well. They do not do well in cold climate 
			as they can succumb easily to cold temperatures.

		<h2>Habits & Lifestyle</h2>
		 <p>
			Owl Finch are very social birds and can be found in groups of up to 40, are very active 
			and curious birds. Only the males sing a soft repetitive song but both sexes emit a 
			'meep' sound which can form into a 'meow' sound like a cat, and will diet on seed,	
			grasses and insects in the wild.
