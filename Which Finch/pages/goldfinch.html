		<h2>Geography</h2>

		 <p>
			Despite where they are natively from, Goldfinches have been introduced all over the
			world from Australia to North America, and can be found in open woodlands, forest 
			edges, thickets, marshy areas, grasslands, orchards, gardens and parks, and will make 
			local movements around to avoid bad weather.

		<h2>Habits & Lifestyle</h2>
		 <p>
			Goldfinches are social birds especially in the winter when they form groups of up to 40 		
			and will cover great distances daily for food. They're seen searching plant to plant 
			for seeds, buds, thistles and fruits and will roost in groups on branches or in bushes 
			at night. Their calls and song are melodic sounds of trills and twitters.
