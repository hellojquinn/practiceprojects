		<h2>Geography</h2>

		 <p>
			Gouldian Finches live only in the far north part of Western Australia and the Northern
			Territory. They live in the tropical savannah, thickets, and woodlands with grassy 
			plains usually near water, but their population status is considered 'near-threatened' 
			due to wildfires and human development for cattle grazing and land clearing.

		<h2>Habits & Lifestyle</h2>
		 <p>
			Gouldian finches are social birds and outside the breeding season, they join
			other flocks that have up to 2,000 finches. In the dry season, they can 
			become more nomadic and move to wherever food and water can be found. They often 	
			forage in small groups and generally silent with occasional soft trills and chirps.
