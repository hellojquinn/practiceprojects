		<h1>Darwin's Finches</h1>
		 <p>
			When Charles Darwin was conducting his studies on the Galapagos Islands,
			he discovered the variety of finches and their method of adapting and changing
			based on their environment. 
			<br>
			<br>
			This discovery led to his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"

		 <h1>In good company</h1>
		 <p>
			All finches are social with beautiful song and need to be in company of other 			 
			finches in a large aviary, but are quiet as their sound doesn't travel far, 
			so they make for wonderful pets.
